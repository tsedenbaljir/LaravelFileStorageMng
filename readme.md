# Laravel 5.5 based system for storing files, registration and Stripe payments

In simple words, it's a mini Dropbox or Google Drive, built with Laravel.

It is a demo project for demonstrating what can be generated with [QuickAdminPanel](https://quickadminpanel.com) tool.

Features:
- Multi-tenancy system: Users can register and upload files/folders, they only see their own entries (admin sees everything)
- Real URLs of the files are hidden under UUID-based URLs for download
- Users can upload up to 5 files, after that they can subscribe to premium plan (payment via Stripe)

# Change Vendor side
$installed = json_decode($this->files->get($path), true);
$packages = $installed['packages'] ?? $installed;
